            <p><h2>Chhattisgarh is a heavily forested state in central India known for its temples and waterfalls. Near the capital Raipur, the town of Sirpur on the Mahanadi River is home to the red-brick Lakshmana (Laxman) Temple, decorated with carvings from Indian mythology. In the south, the city of Jagdalpur hosts the Sanjay Market on Sundays, a bartering place for local tribes. The huge Chitrakoot Falls lie to the northwest. </h2></p>
